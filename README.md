Simulation code for Agentic AI Framework for Cybersecurity
# Agentic AI for Cybersecurity in Uganda

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the simulation code and experimental setup for the **Agentic AI (AAI) Framework**, designed to enhance cybersecurity resilience in **resource-constrained environments** such as Uganda. The framework integrates **reinforcement learning**, **ethical governance**, and **human oversight** to provide an adaptive, ethical, and transparent defense system against evolving cyber threats.

The research is based on the paper:  
**"Agentic AI and National AI Governance in Uganda: Driving Cybersecurity Innovation and Capacity Building for Sustainable Digital Transformation"**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Reinforcement Learning**-based autonomous defense system  
- ✅ **Ethical Governance Layer** ensuring fairness and compliance  
- ✅ **Human Oversight Layer** for transparency and accountability  
- ✅ Optimized for **CPU-only environments**  
- ✅ Simulates **phishing**, **ransomware**, and **DDoS** attacks  
- ✅ Achieves **100% detection rate**, **0% false positives**, and **100% ethical compliance**
